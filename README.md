# Horiseon Landing Page Refactor

## Description

Refactoring the Horiseon landing page, to ensure it meets accessibilty standards.

Using semantic HTML and following accessibility best practices, will make the site more accessible to those with disabilities that make it difficult to navigate the web, as well as those, with of without disability, that prefer to utilise accessibility technologies when navigating the web.

The refactor also has the potential to positively impact their SEO rankings, since search engines rank sites that use properly-applied semantic HTML, more favourably.
